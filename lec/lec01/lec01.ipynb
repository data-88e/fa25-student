    "\n",

    "## Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can use data science to tackle any issue, we must–well–obtain data (kind of mind-boggling, I know).\n",
    "Recall that we want to examine the median incomes of different majors at UC Berkeley as well as the median incomes of those same majors at other colleges.\n",
    "The term 'other colleges' is a fairly general one, and in this case we shall consider the average median incomes of those majors at alll other colleges in the United States.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to obtain a dataset, you can either collect it yourself (via surveys, questionnaires, etc.) or you can use datasets that others have gathered for you.\n",
    "In this demo, we are combining 3 different datasets:\n",
    "- The median income for each major at Cal was obtained from [Cal's 2019 First Destination survey](https://career.berkeley.edu/survey/survey).\n",
    "- The median income for each major overall was obtained from surveys conducted by the American Community Survey (ACS) from 2010 to 2012, a very popular data source for Economics Research! In the survey, ACS essentially calls college graduates and asked them their income as well as what they majored in at college. (As a side note, FiveThirtyEight later published this [article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economic-guide-to-picking-a-college-major/) using the results of the survey.) In this project, we will be using a modified version of the ACS survey - we will only be looking at the respondents who are 28 or younger. Can you think of why we would do this?\n",
    "- The longitudinal data on long-run outcomes of UC Berkeley alumni was obtained from the [University of California webpage](https://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/infocenter/berkeley-outcomes). We will use this dataset later for a slightly different analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to consider the ways in which the 3 different datasets were created. \n",

    "### Mean vs Median\n",
    "Before proceeding further, it is important to consider why we are choosing to look at the median, and not the average, income.\n",
    "In order to answer this question, let us think about what the *distribution* of incomes for a population would look like. \n",
    "Most likely, you would see a high amount of incomes around or slightly below the mean, with a few massive outlier incomes above the mean.\n",
    "For example, consider a theatre major who becomes a star on Broadway - while they'd be doing absolutely fantastic in their career, they are not representative of the average theatre graduate from Berkeley and would likely pull the average income way up.\n",
    "For this reason, using the median is more *robust*: it gives us a better idea of what the typical graduate for any major can generally expect to earn.\n"

In addition, just because EECS has the highest median income overall doesn't mean that any individual is guaranteed a high median income if they decide to major in EECS. Overall, our results are not completely *generalizable* to others.\n",

As a result, these students will likely also find better jobs post-grad. This is what we call a confounding variable -- it is positively correlated with our treatment variable of majoring in EECS.

    "**Utility** is a measure of 'satisfaction' or 'happiness' when we consume a good, while **disutility** is a measure of 'unsatisfaction' or 'harm' when we consume a *bad*. In economics, one assumption we will always make is that people will always seek to maximize their utility and minimize their disutility. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we encounter *diminishing marginal utility* as we consume more and more of a good. For example, the utility of the first cookie you eat is likely much higher than the 20th cookie you eat. Similarly, we may encounter *increasing marginal disutility* as we consume more and more of a bad. For example, the disutility of the first hour doing something you dread is probably not as bad as the 10th hour of doing something you dread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many of us, money provides a source of utility, while working or the studying required to get there may provide a source of disutility. This presents a tradeoff: for some, the disutility from studying EECS or working as a programmer greatly outweights the utility from the money. Perhaps another job in a different field requires significantly lower disutility to achieve, without much impact on the utility of the income associated with it.

    "a top notch developer in the 75th percentile or a subpar developer in the 25th percentile, you will probably make a solid living. Since most CS majors typically end up pursuing similar careers in the realms of software development, there is less **variance** in the occupations. There is also less **risk**: most CS majors can expect to land a software engineering job and continue working as one twenty years into their career.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same story is less true for Economics majors: a top-notch Economics major will significantly out-earn a subpar Economics major. This is partly due to the vastly differing occupation types Economics majors become: analysts, bankers, consultants, just to name a few (Economics is a very versatile degree, afterall). Twenty years down the line, the top Economics majors will have higher ceilings perhaps with a lot of opportunity for leadership or executive positions. There is a lot more **variance** in the types of jobs and thus salaries that Economics majors will attain. In addition, there is a lot more **risk**: not every Economics major will become a top executive, and most end up with more 'average' jobs that earn less than that of similar percentile CS majors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that if you know you are at the top regardless of your major, you will tend to ultimately earn more income as an Economics major than a CS major. But a caveat: it's impossible to guarantee that you will be in the top, no matter how hard you work. Often, life has uncertainties and involves a great deal of luck to become successful."

We did this all using data science techniques and visualizations, while being cognizant of potential sources of error. We will be revisiting a lot of these themes in later parts of the course.\n",
